dice-roller
===========

Just a little dice rolling thing I built while first learning javascript(and programming in general)

dice3.html is the original project.  It works.

dice4.html is my attempt at rewriting the thing without jQuery.  And with an additional year or so of codings experience under my belt.  This version, when complete, will have more features than the original.  The first allowed 6 six-sided dice on one board.  The new one will allow for any-sided dice and multiple boards, among other improvements.
